GetVolunteers
=============

Enables you to show on any website if you need volunteers right now.

Example use case
----------------

Imagine a recurring event that is dependant on volunteers. You have a website 
but no easy way to let people know if you need more help or if you are fine.

With this service you can embed an image into your website. The image will 
look different depending on the number of assigned volunteers. For example 
it could say 'Mentors needed' or 'Mentors found'. If someone clicks on the 
image a new site will open where the user can sign up as new volunteer.

State
-----

Minimal functionality is implemented. Users can not yet sogn up as volunteers.
For now the Admins needs to manually update the volunteer count.
